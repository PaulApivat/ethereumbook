**Common knowledge** is a special kind of (shared) knowledge among a group of people that allow them to act as if a piece of knowledge were fact [3][4]. It is colloquially represented by the phrase, “I know that you know. And I know that you know that I know.” In the context of governance, it allows people to enforce norms (i.e., voting norms, decision-making norms, norms around debate and discussion). [3]
